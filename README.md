React Projcet Defense
This is my project for React course from Software University.

This application has been made to a website so that students, teachers or people who like to educate themselves can solve tests and have fun while doing it.
When using this website you can create an account by signing up as a teacher or a student. Our application is designed to make learning more fun and interesting as you can create not only edicational tests but also friendship test, social topic, music tests and what not. Learning should be fun and accessable not only for students, but for teachers too. You are never to old to learn something new!


If you are a guest browsing the website you can't create and solve a tests you can only search for teachers information if needed.
