# React Project
 
This is my project for React course from Software University.

This application has been made to a website so that students, teachers or people who like to educate themselves can solve tests and have fun while doing it. When using this website you can create an account by signing up as a teacher or a student. Our application is designed to make learning more fun and interesting as you can create not only edicational tests but also friendship test, social topic, music tests and what not. Learning should be fun and accessable not only for students, but for teachers too. You are never to old to learn something new!


# Start the project
To start the project you need to open two terminals.
    First terminal: cd client
                    npm i
                    npm start
                    
    Second terminal: cd server

# Student View
By signing up as a student you have the access to create tests for whatever subject you like, and if you have any difficulties learning for an exam you can go to "Teachers" page and there you will find teachers profile accounts with their qualification and subjects they teach, price range for a private lesson (if needed), their email and phone number.

# Teacher View
By signing up as a teacher you can make your teacher portfolio and write down the subject that you teach, the price that you take for a private or group lesson, phone number and email for further communication and feedback. You can easily create tests for our website and then solve them with your students at school. You can even send them them the link for the test you have created for students do to as a homework or exchange test ideas with other teachers on the platform
